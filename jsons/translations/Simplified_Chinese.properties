Welcome to Emperors and Dieties\nThis is a ruleset mod that focuses on actually building the civ from the ground up.

There are SERVERAL SINIFICANT GAMEPLAY changes from the original civ 5, so you are advised to look through tutorial at least once.\nRemeber to send feedback to the developer in official discord! = 

 # Requires translation!
You may notice the icons are different, props to bucketeer for making these icons.\nMore importantly, settling near fresh water now gives +2 Food to your cities and grants access to more river buildings afterward. There are also more changes toward the resources and tile improvements, overall theres much more rewards in development. But a crucial thing is that luxury resources dont reward happiness anymore.\nThey rewards large amount of stats to maintain your future empires instead. = 

 # Requires translation!
