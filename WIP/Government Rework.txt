Relation in a Civ Bundle: Simulating the diplomatic relations in a civ

Principles:

The more chaotic a civ is, the better it is at discovering new policies and military.
The more stable a civ is, the better it is at expanding, production and growth.
Naturally, multiple countries exists in a civ bundle. Player can choose how chaotic their civ is in order to change their game plan. But they can also choose to be neutral in a few occasion.
Every new age removes the previous government form and replaces it with the default one, or some special cases might also influence this transition.
Normally there will also be events firing upon changing regime.
