# Emperor and Deities
 Major Overhaul of literary everything, if you are not satisfied with how civ 5 portrays human civilisations, you ought to try this mod!

 The Mod is WIP so civs dont have their unique features currently and late game(info age) kinda sucks.

 Credit to 
 Buckeeter aka Wadaling for making full vector icons and tile sets.
 EmperorPenguin for help with proofreading, bug fixing advices

Special thanks to:

Authors of Deciv and Deciv redux, Outlaw of waste, Alpha frontier, Leaders mission 1 and 2, CS reworked, Rek mod, The great unciv rework and the rest of the community.

Great mods and bad mods both pushed me to this point. Its all your fault!
