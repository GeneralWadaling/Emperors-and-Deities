# Emperor and Deities
 Major Overhaul of literary everything, if you are not satisfied with how civ 5 portrays human civilizations, you ought to try this mod!

 The Mod is WIP so civs dont have their unique features currently and late game(info age) kinda sucks.

 Great mods and bad mods both pushed me to this point. Its all your fault!

 Feedback goes to official unciv discord's Emperors and Deities thread, or just open a issue here!

 Feel free to translate this mod and send them to me, so that I may implement it in the mod.
